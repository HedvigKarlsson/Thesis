# Thesis

This project is parted into two files. The file imputering.r contains the code where the dataset is being cleaned up and concentrated. An imputation method is being used where the missing values is being replaced by values simulated from a distribution function based on the remaining values. The file faktoranalys_sistav.r contains an analysis of the data using two statistical models.
